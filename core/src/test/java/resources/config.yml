# These are the global settings for mining. Can be overriden by our custom
# blocks and event code
Mining:
  # When a player stops mining a block, it will pause the breaking animation at
  # where it was, and resume when they continue mining it
  Save Progress: true
  # How many seconds after saving progress on block to delete progress.
  # This is to maximise performance and reduce lag, only works if Save Progress is enabled
  Cleanup Delay: 10
  # Seconds after a block starts being broken to remove the breaking task.
  # This is in order to clear any tasks that didn't get enabled and not lag the server.
  # If you have long break times set this high so it doesn't clear as they're breaking.
  # Default clear every 5 minutes of old tasks
  Cleanup Threshold: 300
  # If set to true, all players in the radius when breaking a block
  # will see the breaking animation
  Broadcast Animation: true

# Refer to https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Breaking#Calculation for base calculations
# All except for last are taken as breakSpeed = {equation}
Modifiers:
  # The calculation used to factor in efficiency. Only applies if is appropriate tool
  Efficiency Calculation: "{breakSpeed} + ({efficiencyLevel} ^ 2 + 1)"
  # The calculation factoring in the haste potion effect
  Haste Calculation: "{breakSpeed} * (1 + (0.2 * {hasteLevel}))"
  # The mining fatigue calculation at each level
  Fatigue Calculation:
    1: "{breakSpeed} * 0.3"
    2: "{breakSpeed} * 0.09"
    3: "{breakSpeed} * 0.0027"
    # Any other level
    other: "{breakSpeed} * 0.00081"
  # The calculation that is applied when player is in water
  Water Calculation: "{breakSpeed} / 5"
  # The calculation that is applied when player isn't on ground
  Air Calculation: "{breakSpeed} / 5"
  # This is the final equation. Break speed is the speed that has gone through
  # all other calculations such as tool speed and efficiency and inWater or not. This returns
  # the final damage to be dealt. Final time in ticks is taken from "roundup(1 / damage)"
  Breaktime Calculation: "({breakSpeed} / {hardness}) * (1 / ({doesToolHelp} ? 30 : 100))"
